# Rock-Paper-Scissors

A quick and fair way to assign work, push the blame, and settle grudges. (Now, with logs and history!)

## Rules:

🕊️ Create and checkout a new branch; `who-pays-for-lunch`, `tom-vs-dan`, and `who-makes-release` are all perfectly valid branch names.
🤞 Players commit & push an empty commit (`git commit -m "I will definitely win" --allow-empty`).
⚖️ GHA will run a simple job to determine the winner: absolutely random and unbiased!
👀 Check your results in the completed actions.
🏆 The winner gets eternal fame and glory!
